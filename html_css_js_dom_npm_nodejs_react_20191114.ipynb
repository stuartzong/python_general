    "Throughout this lesson, you learned how to select HTML elements with CSS and apply styles to them. Letâ€™s review what you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "    CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.\n",
    "    CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.\n",
    "    Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.\n",
    "    Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.\n",
    "    IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.\n",
    "    Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.\n",
    "    Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.\n",
    "    The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.\n",
    "    Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.\n",
